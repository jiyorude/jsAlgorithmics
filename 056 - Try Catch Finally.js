/*
CHALLENGE:
Explain 'try', 'catch' and 'finally'
as seen on freeCodeCamp
*/

// try... catch allows us to try code blocks and catch errors.
// In "try", we specify the function or code we'd like to run.
// In Catch, we specify what JavaScript should return if the code were to fail. Instead of dying, the code will return this instead.
// In finally, we should put a correct code execution: a guarantee if you will that your code will execute.
// Throw allows you to create custom errors.
