/*
CHALLENGE:
Explain 'try', 'catch' and 'finally'
*/

// try... catch allows us to try code blocks and catch errors. We can also specify custom errors.

// TRY -  we specify the function or code we'd like to run.
// CATCH -  we specify what JavaScript should return if the code were to fail. Instead of dying, the code will return this instead.
// FINALLY -  we should put a correct code execution: a guarantee if you will that your code will execute.
// THROW -  allows you to create custom errors.
